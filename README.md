# Algorithms for Navigation

This is the content of a talk about three algorithms to for navigation:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm
2. A*
3. Fast marching method 

It also includes a detailed description on how to solve the eikonal equation on a Catesian 2D grid, and some hints on how to use the travel speed function of the equation to model different navigation behaviours.

The content of the talk is in German.
